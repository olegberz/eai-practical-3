# Practice 2: Event-Driven Messaging with RabbitMQ

**Course:** Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)
**Submission deadline:** 08.03.2026, 20:00 EET (Europe/Riga, UTC+2)
**Submission format:** Public GitHub repository URL sent by email to martins.leitass@turiba.lv
**Total points:** 25 (23 automated + 2 manual review); Passing score 60%;

## Learning Objectives

By completing this practice, you will:

- Implement the **Publish-Subscribe** pattern using a RabbitMQ fanout exchange
- Configure **Dead Letter Queues** with TTL-based delayed retry for failed messages
- Propagate a **Correlation Identifier** across producer, consumers, and result events
- Implement **Guaranteed Delivery** using manual acknowledgements and retry logic
- Build an **Idempotent Receiver** with file-based deduplication

---

## Business Scenario

An e-commerce company needs event-driven communication between its order processing services. When a customer places an order:

1. The **Order Service** accepts the order via HTTP, generates a unique correlation ID, and publishes an `order.placed` event to RabbitMQ
2. Three independent consumer services receive the same event simultaneously:
   - **Payment Service** validates the payment (simulated with a configurable failure rate)
   - **Inventory Service** checks stock availability (simulated with a configurable failure rate)
   - **Notification Service** logs the order for customer notification
3. When a consumer fails to process a message, the message is automatically retried after a 1-second delay
4. After 3 failed attempts, the message is sent to a Dead Letter Queue for manual inspection
5. Every message carries a correlation ID so the full lifecycle of an order can be traced
6. The Notification Service must be **idempotent** — receiving the same order event twice must not create duplicate log entries

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Docker Desktop** installed and running (with Docker Compose support)
- **Node.js 18+** installed (`node --version` to verify)
- **Git** configured with a GitHub account
- **curl** or Postman for API testing
- The following ports available: `3000`, `5672`, `15672`

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the environment

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Or run detached:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

If your Docker installation uses the plugin syntax, replace docker-compose with docker compose in all commands in this README.

Wait for all services to initialize. RabbitMQ takes ~15 seconds for its health check to pass before other services start.

### 2. Verify services are running

**Order Service health check:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"ok"}`

**RabbitMQ Management UI:**

Open [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672) in your browser.
- Username: `guest`
- Password: `guest`

Navigate to the **Queues** tab — you should see all 10 queues declared and ready.

### 3. Stop the environment

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To also remove volumes (clears all persistent data):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## What's Provided

You receive a fully configured infrastructure. **Do not modify** any of the following files unless explicitly instructed:

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, edit only the four service server.js files and your own submission README content; treat all scaffold/infrastructure files as read-only.

| Component | Files | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Docker orchestration | `docker-compose.yml` | Starts RabbitMQ + all 4 services with correct networking, environment variables, and volumes |
| RabbitMQ topology | `rabbitmq/definitions.json`, `rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf` | Pre-declares all exchanges, queues, and bindings (including retry and DLQ infrastructure) |
| Shared helper | `shared/rabbit.js` | `connectWithRetry()` and `getRetryCount()` utilities for your services |
| Payment scaffold | `payment-service/server.js` | Partial implementation with connection, consume loop, and retry/DLQ logic. You complete the TODO. |
| Dockerfiles | `*/Dockerfile` | Standard Node.js 18 Alpine containers for each service |
| Dependencies | `*/package.json` | npm dependencies pre-declared for each service |
| Test suite | `test/test-runner.test.js`, `test/helpers/rabbit-helper.js` | 7 automated tests that validate your implementation |
| Grading | `grading/report.js`, `.github/workflows/grade.yml` | Auto-grading pipeline that runs on every git push |

---

## Shared Helper API Reference

The file `shared/rabbit.js` is mounted read-only at `/app/shared/rabbit.js` inside every container. Import it in your services:

```javascript
const { connectWithRetry, getRetryCount } = require('/app/shared/rabbit');
```

### `connectWithRetry(url, retries?, delay?)`

Connects to RabbitMQ with exponential backoff retry. Handles the common startup race condition where your Node.js service starts before RabbitMQ is fully ready.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | string | (required) | AMQP connection URL, e.g. `amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672` |
| `retries` | number | 10 | Maximum connection attempts |
| `delay` | number | 3000 | Initial delay in ms (doubles each attempt, capped at 30s) |

**Returns:** `Promise<{ connection, channel }>` — an AMQP connection and a single channel ready to use.

**Example:**

```javascript
const { connection, channel } = await connectWithRetry(process.env.RABBITMQ_URL);
```

### `getRetryCount(msg)`

Parses the RabbitMQ `x-death` header to determine how many times a message has been retried via the dead-letter exchange.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `msg` | object | The AMQP message object received in a `channel.consume()` callback |

**Returns:** `number` — the total retry count. Returns `0` if the message has never been retried.

**Example:**

```javascript
const retryCount = getRetryCount(msg);
if (retryCount >= parseInt(process.env.MAX_RETRIES) - 1) {
  // Message has been retried too many times — send to DLQ
}
```

---

## Environment Variables Reference

These are set automatically by `docker-compose.yml`. Use `process.env.<NAME>` in your code.

| Variable | Available In | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RABBITMQ_URL` | All services | `amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672` | Full AMQP connection string |
| `PORT` | order-service | `3000` | HTTP port for Express server |
| `PAYMENT_FAIL_RATE` | payment-service | `20` | Percentage (0-100) of payment validations that fail |
| `INVENTORY_FAIL_RATE` | inventory-service | `10` | Percentage (0-100) of inventory checks that fail |
| `DLQ_EXCHANGE` | payment, inventory, notification | `orders.dlq.exchange` | Exchange name for dead letter messages |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | payment, inventory, notification | `3` | Maximum processing attempts before sending to DLQ |

---

## What You Must Build

You need to write code in **4 files**. Three are empty (`server.js`), one has a TODO to complete.

### A. Order Service (`order-service/server.js`)

Build an Express HTTP server that accepts orders and publishes them to RabbitMQ.

**Requirements:**

1. `GET /health` — returns HTTP 200 with `{ "status": "ok" }`
2. `POST /orders` — accepts an order, publishes it to RabbitMQ, returns the correlation ID
3. `GET /orders/:correlationId` — returns a previously submitted order, or 404 if not found

**Pseudocode:**

```
IMPORT express, uuid, connectWithRetry

orders = []    // in-memory store

CONNECT to RabbitMQ using connectWithRetry(RABBITMQ_URL)

ON POST /orders:
    correlationId = generate UUID v4
    orderId = generate short ID (e.g., "ord-" + first 8 chars of UUID)
    timestamp = current ISO timestamp

    enrichedOrder = { ...request.body, orderId, correlationId, timestamp }

    PUBLISH enrichedOrder to "orders.exchange" with:
        content: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(enrichedOrder))
        routing key: "" (empty string — fanout ignores it but it's required)
        options: { headers: { correlationId }, contentType: "application/json" }

    STORE enrichedOrder in orders array

    RESPOND 201 { correlationId, status: "accepted" }

ON GET /orders/:correlationId:
    FIND order in orders array by correlationId
    IF found: RESPOND 200 with order
    ELSE: RESPOND 404

ON GET /health:
    RESPOND 200 { status: "ok" }

START Express server on process.env.PORT (default 3000)
```

**Key details:**
- You must `await` the RabbitMQ connection before starting the Express listener
- Use `channel.publish(exchangeName, routingKey, content, options)` to publish
- The routing key must be an empty string `''` for fanout exchanges (it is ignored but still required as a parameter)
- The message content must be a `Buffer`, not a plain object — use `Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(...))`
- The `correlationId` goes in `options.headers`, not only in the message body

---

### B. Payment Service (`payment-service/server.js`) — Complete the TODO

This service is **partially implemented**. Open the file and study the provided code.

**What's already provided:**
- RabbitMQ connection with `connectWithRetry`
- Consumer loop on `payments.queue` with `prefetch(1)`
- Message parsing, correlationId extraction, retry count tracking
- Complete retry/DLQ logic in the `catch` block (study this carefully — you will replicate it in other services)

**What you must implement** (replace the `throw new Error('Not implemented...')` line):

```
// Inside the try block:

IF Math.random() * 100 < FAIL_RATE:
    THROW new Error("Payment rejected")   // triggers the catch block → retry/DLQ

// If we reach here, payment succeeded:
ACK the message
PUBLISH result event to RESULTS_EXCHANGE with:
    content: {
        correlationId, source: "payment", status: "success",
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        details: { message: "Payment validated successfully" }
    }
    options: { headers: { correlationId }, contentType: "application/json" }
RETURN   // skip the catch block
```

**Important:** When payment succeeds, you must `ack` the message **and** publish a result event **before** the code reaches the `catch` block. Use `return` after your success logic so the catch block does not execute on success.

---

### C. Inventory Service (`inventory-service/server.js`)

Build from scratch, following the same pattern as the Payment Service. The provided payment scaffold is your reference implementation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
IMPORT connectWithRetry, getRetryCount

QUEUE = "inventory.queue"
RESULTS_EXCHANGE = "results.inventory"
MAX_RETRIES = parse int from process.env.MAX_RETRIES (default 3)
FAIL_RATE = parse int from process.env.INVENTORY_FAIL_RATE (default 10)

CONNECT to RabbitMQ using connectWithRetry(RABBITMQ_URL)
SET channel.prefetch(1)

CONSUME from QUEUE with callback(msg):
    IF msg is null: RETURN

    PARSE order from msg.content (Buffer → string → JSON)
    READ correlationId from msg.properties.headers.correlationId
    READ retryCount from getRetryCount(msg)

    TRY:
        IF Math.random() * 100 < FAIL_RATE:
            THROW error("Inventory check failed")

        // Success path:
        ACK message
        PUBLISH result event to RESULTS_EXCHANGE with correlationId in headers
        RETURN

    CATCH error:
        IF retryCount >= MAX_RETRIES - 1:
            PUBLISH original message content to DLQ_EXCHANGE (preserve original headers)
            ACK message    // remove from consumer queue
        ELSE:
            NACK(msg, false, false)    // triggers DLX → retry queue → return
```

**Key details:**
- This is structurally identical to the Payment Service — adapt the queue name, exchange name, environment variable, and log messages
- Always check `if (!msg) return;` at the start of the consume callback
- Use `channel.publish(exchange, '', content, { headers })` for result events
- Use `channel.nack(msg, false, false)` — the second `false` means "do not requeue" which triggers the dead-letter exchange

---

### D. Notification Service (`notification-service/server.js`)

Build from scratch. This service has additional complexity: **file-based idempotency tracking**.

**Pseudocode:**

```
IMPORT connectWithRetry, getRetryCount, fs

QUEUE = "notifications.queue"
RESULTS_EXCHANGE = "results.notification"
PROCESSED_IDS_FILE = "/data/processed-ids.json"
NOTIFICATION_LOG_FILE = "/data/notification.log"

// Load previously processed IDs on startup
TRY:
    processedIds = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(PROCESSED_IDS_FILE, "utf8"))
CATCH:
    processedIds = []    // file doesn't exist yet on first run — that's fine

CONNECT to RabbitMQ using connectWithRetry(RABBITMQ_URL)
SET channel.prefetch(1)

CONSUME from QUEUE with callback(msg):
    IF msg is null: RETURN

    PARSE order from msg.content
    READ correlationId from msg.properties.headers.correlationId
    READ retryCount from getRetryCount(msg)

    // === Idempotency check (MUST happen before any processing) ===
    IF processedIds includes correlationId:
        ACK message                      // already processed — skip silently
        LOG "Duplicate skipped: {correlationId}"
        RETURN

    TRY:
        // Build log entry
        logEntry = {
            correlationId,
            orderId: order.orderId,
            customerId: order.customerId,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
            message: "Order received"
        }

        // Append to notification log (JSON Lines format: one object per line)
        fs.appendFileSync(NOTIFICATION_LOG_FILE, JSON.stringify(logEntry) + "\n")

        // Track this correlationId as processed
        processedIds.push(correlationId)
        fs.writeFileSync(PROCESSED_IDS_FILE, JSON.stringify(processedIds))

        ACK message
        PUBLISH result event to RESULTS_EXCHANGE with correlationId in headers
        RETURN

    CATCH error:
        // Same retry/DLQ logic as payment and inventory services
        IF retryCount >= MAX_RETRIES - 1:
            PUBLISH to DLQ_EXCHANGE with original headers, then ACK
        ELSE:
            NACK(msg, false, false)
```

**Key details:**
- The notification log (`/data/notification.log`) must use **JSON Lines** format: one JSON object per line, separated by `\n`. **Not** a JSON array.
- The processed IDs file (`/data/processed-ids.json`) is a JSON array of correlation ID strings.
- On first startup, the files do not exist. Your code must handle this gracefully with a try/catch around the file read, defaulting to an empty array.
- The `/data` directory is bind-mounted from your host filesystem. Files persist across container restarts.
- The idempotency check must happen **before** any processing logic. If the correlationId is already known, just `ack` and return immediately.

## Message Schemas

### POST /orders Request Body

```json
{
  "customerId": "cust-123",
  "items": [
    { "productId": "prod-001", "quantity": 2, "unitPrice": 29.99 },
    { "productId": "prod-002", "quantity": 1, "unitPrice": 149.99 }
  ],
  "totalAmount": 209.97,
  "orderType": "standard"
}
```

### POST /orders Response (HTTP 201)

```json
{
  "correlationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "accepted"
}
```

### Order Event (published to `orders.exchange`)

Message body:

```json
{
  "orderId": "ord-550e8400",
  "correlationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "customerId": "cust-123",
  "items": [
    { "productId": "prod-001", "quantity": 2, "unitPrice": 29.99 },
    { "productId": "prod-002", "quantity": 1, "unitPrice": 149.99 }
  ],
  "totalAmount": 209.97,
  "orderType": "standard",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-01T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

AMQP publish options:

```javascript
{
  headers: { correlationId: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" },
  contentType: "application/json"
}
```

### Result Event (published by each consumer to its `results.*` exchange)

```json
{
  "correlationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "source": "payment",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-01T10:00:01.234Z",
  "details": {
    "message": "Payment validated successfully"
  }

  headers: { correlationId: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" },
  contentType: "application/json"
}
```

The `source` field should be `"payment"`, `"inventory"`, or `"notification"` depending on the service.

---

## RabbitMQ Topology

All exchanges, queues, and bindings are pre-configured in `rabbitmq/definitions.json`. You do **not** need to create them in your code. This section is a reference to help you understand the messaging infrastructure your code interacts with.

### Exchanges

| Exchange | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `orders.exchange` | fanout | Distributes order events to all 3 consumer queues |
| `orders.retry.exchange` | direct | Routes failed (nacked) messages to service-specific retry queues |
| `orders.return.exchange` | direct | Routes retried messages back to their specific consumer queue after TTL |
| `orders.dlq.exchange` | fanout | Routes exhausted messages to the dead letter queue |
| `results.payment` | fanout | Payment service publishes result events here |
| `results.inventory` | fanout | Inventory service publishes result events here |
| `results.notification` | fanout | Notification service publishes result events here |

### Queues

| Queue | Special Arguments | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `payments.queue` | DLX: `orders.retry.exchange` | Payment consumer reads from here |
| `inventory.queue` | DLX: `orders.retry.exchange` | Inventory consumer reads from here |
| `notifications.queue` | DLX: `orders.retry.exchange` | Notification consumer reads from here |
| `payments.retry.queue` | TTL: 1000ms, DLX: `orders.return.exchange` | Holds failed payment messages for 1s before returning them |
| `inventory.retry.queue` | TTL: 1000ms, DLX: `orders.return.exchange` | Holds failed inventory messages for 1s |
| `notifications.retry.queue` | TTL: 1000ms, DLX: `orders.return.exchange` | Holds failed notification messages for 1s |
| `orders.dlq` | (none) | Final destination for messages that exceeded max retries |
| `payment.results` | (none) | Payment result events (used by test suite) |
| `inventory.results` | (none) | Inventory result events (used by test suite) |
| `notification.results` | (none) | Notification result events (used by test suite) |

### Retry Flow — Step by Step

This is the most important mechanism to understand. Here is what happens when a consumer **fails** to process a message:

```
1. Consumer receives message from payments.queue (attempt 1)
2. Processing fails → consumer calls channel.nack(msg, false, false)
3. RabbitMQ routes message to orders.retry.exchange (dead-letter exchange)
4. orders.retry.exchange (direct) routes to payments.retry.queue
5. Message sits in payments.retry.queue for 1 second (TTL)
6. After TTL expires, RabbitMQ dead-letters to orders.return.exchange
7. orders.return.exchange (direct) routes back to payments.queue only
8. Consumer receives the message again — x-death header now has count = 1
9. getRetryCount(msg) returns 1 → this is attempt 2
10. If processing fails again → repeat steps 2-9 (count increments)
11. On attempt 3: getRetryCount returns 2 (which is >= MAX_RETRIES - 1)
    → Consumer publishes message to orders.dlq.exchange
    → Consumer acks the message (removes it from payments.queue)
    → Message lands in orders.dlq
```

**Why ack + publish to DLQ instead of just nacking?** Because `nack(msg, false, false)` always sends to the retry exchange — that is what the queue's dead-letter-exchange is configured to do. To break out of the retry cycle and send to the DLQ instead, you must `ack` the message (removing it from the retry loop) and manually `publish` it to `orders.dlq.exchange`.

---

## Grading Criteria

Your submission is graded automatically when you push to GitHub. The test suite runs via GitHub Actions and produces a grade report.

| # | Criterion | Points | What the Test Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Services start without errors | 3 | Checks Order Service `/health` returns 200, RabbitMQ management API is reachable, all 3 consumer queues have active consumers |
| 2 | `POST /orders` returns valid correlation ID | 4 | Posts an order, verifies HTTP 201 with UUID v4 `correlationId` and `status: "accepted"`. Also verifies `GET /orders/:correlationId` returns the stored order. |
| 3 | Exchange and queue topology correct | 3 | Verifies `orders.exchange` exists as fanout type, all 3 consumer queues have at least 1 active consumer |
| 4 | DLQ receives failed messages after retries | 4 | Sets `PAYMENT_FAIL_RATE=100`, restarts payment-service, posts an order, waits for retry cycles, checks `orders.dlq` for a message with matching correlationId |
| 5 | Correlation ID propagated through all consumers | 3 | Posts an order with 0% failure rate, consumes from `payment.results`, `inventory.results`, and `notification.results`. Verifies all three carry the original correlationId in headers. |
| 6 | Idempotent notification | 4 | Posts an order, waits 3s, verifies `notification.log` has exactly 1 entry. Manually publishes the same event again with the same correlationId, waits 3s, verifies the log still has only 1 entry. Also checks `processed-ids.json`. |
| 7 | Retry logic (3 attempts before DLQ) | 2 | Sets `PAYMENT_FAIL_RATE=100`, posts an order, waits for retries, checks `x-death` header on the DLQ message shows retry count >= 2 |
| 8 | Code quality and README | 2 | **Manual review.** Your README must contain a message flow explanation and an EAI pattern mapping table (see below). |

**Total: 25 points** (23 automated + 2 manual)

## Testing Your Work

### Send a test order

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "cust-123",
    "items": [
      { "productId": "prod-001", "quantity": 2, "unitPrice": 29.99 },
      { "productId": "prod-002", "quantity": 1, "unitPrice": 149.99 }
    ],
    "totalAmount": 209.97,
    "orderType": "standard"
  }'
```

Expected response (HTTP 201):

```json
{ "correlationId": "<uuid>", "status": "accepted" }
```

### Retrieve an order

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/orders/<correlationId-from-previous-response>
```

### Inspect RabbitMQ

Open [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672) (guest/guest) and check:
- **Queues tab** — see messages flowing through queues, check consumer counts
- **Exchanges tab** — verify `orders.exchange` has bindings to 3 queues
- **Get Messages** button on any queue — peek at message contents and headers

This is your best debugging tool. If messages are not arriving at a consumer, check whether they are sitting in the queue and whether the queue has an active consumer.

### Run the test suite locally

Make sure all services are running (`docker-compose up -d --build`), then:

```bash
cd test
npm install
npx jest --runInBand --forceExit
```

Each test prints a pass/fail result. Failed tests include an error message explaining what was expected vs. what happened.

### Generate a grade report

After running tests with JSON output:

```bash
cd test
npx jest --runInBand --forceExit --json --outputFile=results.json
cd ..
node grading/report.js test/results.json
```

This creates `grade-report.md` in the project root with your score breakdown.

## Submission Instructions

### Deadline

**08.03.2026, 20:00 EET (Europe/Riga, UTC+2)**

### Format

1. Create a **public GitHub repository** containing your completed project
2. Push all your code — the entire project directory including your implemented `server.js` files
3. Submit the repository URL by email to martins.leitass@turiba.lv.

### Your repository must include

- Working `order-service/server.js`
- Working `payment-service/server.js` (with TODO completed)
- Working `inventory-service/server.js`
- Working `notification-service/server.js`
- `README.md` with your own content (see below)

### README requirements (2 points)

Your README must contain the following two sections. You may extend or replace this README, but these must be present:

1. **Message flow explanation** — a written description (1-2 paragraphs) of what happens when `POST /orders` is called, tracing the message from Order Service through RabbitMQ to all three consumers, including what happens on failure.

2. **EAI Pattern mapping table** — identify where each pattern is applied and explain it in your own words:

    | Pattern | Where Applied | Your Explanation |
    |---|---|---|
    | Publish-Subscribe Channel | | |
    | Dead Letter Channel | | |
    | Correlation Identifier | | |
    | Guaranteed Delivery | | |
    | Idempotent Receiver | | |

### Before you submit

1. Start from clean state: `docker-compose down -v`
2. Build and start: `docker-compose up --build`
3. Wait ~20 seconds for everything to initialize
4. Run tests: `cd test && npm install && npx jest --runInBand --forceExit`
5. Verify all 7 tests pass
6. Verify your README has the required sections
7. Push to GitHub and confirm the Actions workflow completes successfully

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Order Service** — start here. Get `POST /orders` working and verify that messages appear in the RabbitMQ Management UI (check `payments.queue`, `inventory.queue`, and `notifications.queue` for messages).

2. **Payment Service** — open `payment-service/server.js`, study the provided scaffold, and replace the TODO. Run the system and observe retry behavior in the RabbitMQ UI when payments fail.

3. **Inventory Service** — adapt the Payment Service pattern. Change the queue name, exchange name, environment variable, and log messages.

4. **Notification Service** — build last. This service adds file I/O and idempotency on top of the consumer pattern you have now implemented twice. Test idempotency by publishing a duplicate message via the RabbitMQ Management UI (Queues tab -> `notifications.queue` -> Publish message).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port conflicts

If ports 3000, 5672, or 15672 are already in use:

```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# macOS / Linux
lsof -i :3000
```

Stop the conflicting process or modify `docker-compose.yml` to use different host ports.

### Services fail to connect to RabbitMQ

The helper uses exponential backoff retries (default up to 10 attempts); delay starts at 3000 ms and doubles each attempt, capped at 30000 ms per attempt.

```bash
# Check RabbitMQ logs
docker-compose logs rabbitmq

# Restart everything from scratch
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```

### "Module not found: /app/shared/rabbit"

The shared helper is mounted from the `shared/` directory. Make sure:
- Your Dockerfile has `WORKDIR /app` (it does by default — do not change this)
- You import with `require('/app/shared/rabbit')` (absolute path, not relative)

### Message published but consumer does not receive it

1. Open RabbitMQ Management UI -> Queues tab
2. Check if messages are sitting in the expected queue
3. Verify the queue shows `Consumers: 1` (your consumer is connected)
4. Check consumer logs: `docker-compose logs payment-service`

### Notification log format errors

The test expects **JSON Lines** format — one JSON object per line:

```
{"correlationId":"abc","orderId":"ord-1","customerId":"cust-1","timestamp":"...","message":"Order received"}
{"correlationId":"def","orderId":"ord-2","customerId":"cust-2","timestamp":"...","message":"Order received"}
```

**Not** a JSON array like `[{...}, {...}]`.

Use `fs.appendFileSync(path, JSON.stringify(entry) + '\n')`.

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What Goes Wrong |
|---|---|
| Using `nack(msg, false, true)` instead of `nack(msg, false, false)` | Message requeues immediately without retry delay. Infinite loop, no x-death header. |
| Forgetting to `ack` before publishing to DLQ | Message stays in consumer queue AND goes to DLQ. |
| Not calling `channel.prefetch(1)` | Multiple messages dispatched at once, ack order breaks. |
| Generating a new correlationId in consumers | Each consumer gets a different ID. Read it from `msg.properties.headers.correlationId`. |
| Publishing result events without `correlationId` in headers | Tests cannot trace the result back to the original order. |
| Using wrong env var name (e.g., `FAIL_RATE` instead of `PAYMENT_FAIL_RATE`) | Service never fails because env var is undefined. |
| Hardcoding `amqp://localhost:5672` | Works on host but fails inside Docker where hostname is `rabbitmq`. Use `process.env.RABBITMQ_URL`. |
| Writing notification.log as a JSON array | Test expects JSON Lines (one object per line). |
| Not handling `msg === null` in consume callback | Consumer crashes when channel is cancelled. Always check `if (!msg) return;` first. |
| Starting Express listener before RabbitMQ connects | HTTP requests arrive before channel exists. Await the connection first. |
